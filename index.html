      <section class="mb-8">
        <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-4">Top 1990s Toyota Models</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Here are the standout Toyota models from the 1990s, known for their reliability, style, and lasting value.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl mb-3">1. Toyota Camry (1992–1996, 1997–2001)</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">The Camry was a bestseller in the 1990s, known for its quiet ride and durability. With engine options like the 2.2L I4 (130 hp) and 3.0L V6 (188 hp), it offered a balance of efficiency and power. Many Camrys from this era have surpassed 250,000 miles with routine maintenance.</p>
        <p class="mb-4"><strong>Why It’s Great:</strong> Spacious interior, reliable engines, strong resale value.</p>
        <p class="mb-4"><strong>Considerations:</strong> Higher mileage models may need suspension or transmission repairs.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl mb-3">2. Toyota Corolla (1993–1997, 1998–2002)</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">The Corolla was a top choice for budget-conscious buyers, offering 1.6L I4 (105 hp) and 1.8L I4 (115 hp) engines. Its compact size and excellent fuel economy made it ideal for students and commuters. The Corolla is often cited as the most reliable Toyota of the decade.</p>
        <p class="mb-4"><strong>Why It’s Great:</strong> Low maintenance costs, excellent fuel economy, long lifespan.</p>
        <p class="mb-4"><strong>Considerations:</strong> Basic interior, limited cargo space.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl mb-3">3. Toyota Supra (1993–1998)</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">The fourth-generation Supra is a legend among car enthusiasts, thanks to its 3.0L twin-turbo 2JZ-GTE engine (320 hp). Its sleek design and performance capabilities make it a collector’s favorite, with well-maintained models fetching high prices today.</p>
        <p class="mb-4"><strong>Why It’s Great:</strong> Iconic design, high performance, collectible value.</p>
        <p class="mb-4"><strong>Considerations:</strong> High maintenance costs, limited availability.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl mb-3">4. Toyota 4Runner (1990–1995, 1996–2002)</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">The 4Runner combined rugged capability with Toyota’s reliability. With engines like the 3.0L V6 and later 3.4L V6, it was a favorite for off-road enthusiasts and families needing durability. Many 4Runners from this era still run strong past 200,000 miles.</p>
        <p class="mb-4"><strong>Why It’s Great:</strong> Off-road capability, durable build, spacious interior.</p>
        <p class="mb-4"><strong>Considerations:</strong> Lower fuel economy, potential rust issues in older models.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl mb-3">5. Toyota Tercel (1991–1999)</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">The Tercel was Toyota’s smallest car in the U.S. during the 1990s, offering a 1.5L I4 engine and exceptional fuel efficiency. It was a practical choice for first-time drivers and budget buyers.</p>
        <p class="mb-4"><strong>Why It’s Great:</strong> Affordable, fuel-efficient, easy to maintain.</p>
        <p class="mb-4"><strong>Considerations:</strong> Minimal features, discontinued after 1999.</p>
